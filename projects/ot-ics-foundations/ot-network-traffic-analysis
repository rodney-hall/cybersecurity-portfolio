# OT Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark)

## Overview
This project demonstrates analysis of Operational Technology (OT) network traffic using Wireshark. The focus is on identifying and interpreting industrial protocols commonly found in building automation and industrial control system (ICS) environments.

## Protocols Analyzed
- BACnet (Building Automation and Control Networks)
- Modbus/TCP (Industrial Control Systems)

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Sample OT protocol PCAP files

## Analysis Performed
- Applied protocol-specific display filters
- Identified device discovery and control messages
- Expanded and interpreted protocol fields (APDU / NPDU, function codes)
- Observed unencrypted OT traffic behavior

## Key Takeaways
- OT protocols often lack encryption and authentication
- Network visibility is critical for detecting unauthorized activity
- Wireshark can be used to monitor and baseline OT traffic patterns

## Evidence
Screenshots demonstrate filtered traffic, protocol breakdowns, and message interpretation.

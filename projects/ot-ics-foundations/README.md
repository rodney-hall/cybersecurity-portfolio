# OT/ICS Foundations Mini-Lab
**Purdue Model + IT/OT Segmentation**

## Overview
This mini-lab demonstrates foundational understanding of OT/ICS network segmentation using the Purdue Model and an OT DMZ. The focus is on protecting operational availability and safety by limiting direct IT-to-OT access.

## What This Lab Covers
- IT vs OT priorities (business systems vs physical processes)
- OT DMZ as a controlled buffer zone
- Purdue Model Levels 0–5
- Segmentation to reduce lateral movement and operational impact

- 🧾 **OT Incident Evidence Checklist:** [View checklist](evidence-checklist.md)

## Status
Completed foundational OT/ICS security lab focused on IT/OT segmentation, Purdue Model levels, and OT incident documentation.

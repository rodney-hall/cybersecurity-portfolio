# Google Cybersecurity Certificate – SIEM Investigation Project

**Date Completed:** May 2025  
**Type:** Incident Response Simulation  
**Tools Used:** SIEM Platform (Simulated), Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), Ticketing

## 🔍 Overview
This hands-on project involved analyzing a simulated attack using SIEM alerts and log data. I identified the root cause, tracked the attacker's movement, and created an incident report outlining detection, containment, and response actions.

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Interpreted SIEM alerts tied to phishing and malware activity
- Traced indicators across multiple log sources
- Drafted a clear, concise incident response write-up

## 📁 Artifacts
- [Incident Report PDF](./google-assets/siem-incident-report.pdf)
- [Alert Summary & IOC Table](./google-assets/siem-iocs.csv)

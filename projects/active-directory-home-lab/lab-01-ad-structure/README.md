# Active Directory Home Lab — Lab 01 (AD Structure)

**Goal:** Build a clean multi-region AD OU structure and populate it with realistic users, groups, and computer/server objects.

## What I built

- Created OUs for **USA / Europe / Asia**
- Added **Users / Computers / Servers** containers per region
- Created department OUs (IT, HR, Accounting, Sales, Management)
- Added sample users + security groups
- Created computer + server objects with realistic naming conventions

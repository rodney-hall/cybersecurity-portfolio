# OT Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark)

## Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on analysis of Operational Technology (OT) network traffic using Wireshark. The focus is on understanding how industrial protocols communicate, identifying device discovery behavior, and interpreting unencrypted control traffic in OT environments.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Sample OT protocol PCAP files

## Protocols Analyzed
- BACnet (Building Automation and Control Networks)
- Modbus/TCP (Industrial Control Systems)

## Analysis Performed
- Applied protocol-specific display filters in Wireshark
- Identified broadcast and device discovery traffic (Who-Is / I-Am)
- Expanded and interpreted NPDU and APDU protocol fields
- Observed unencrypted OT control communications
- Analyzed protocol behavior relevant to monitoring and incident detection

## Key Takeaways
- Many OT protocols operate without encryption or authentication
- Broadcast-based discovery is common in OT environments
- Network visibility is critical for detecting unauthorized activity
- Wireshark is effective for baselining and investigating OT traffic

## Evidence
Screenshots demonstrate filtered traffic, protocol breakdowns, and message interpretation.

## Status
In progress — BACnet analysis complete. Modbus/TCP analysis will be added using the same workflow.

## Featured Projects (Hands-On)

### OT Linux Baseline & Service Visibility Lab
Established a safe operational baseline for a Linux system in an OT-adjacent environment using passive inspection techniques.
- Verified system identity and health
- Enumerated running services and processes
- Identified listening network ports without intrusive scanning
- Applied availability-first OT security principles

**Project:** [OT Linux Baseline & Visibility Lab](projects/ot-linux-baseline-lab/)

### OT/ICS Foundations Mini-Lab (Purdue Model + IT/OT Segmentation)
Foundational OT security lab focused on how enterprise IT and operational technology (OT) environments are separated to protect uptime and safety.
- Simple IT ↔ OT segmentation diagram with an OT DMZ
- Purdue Model overview (Levels 0–5)
- OT incident evidence checklist for escalation-ready reporting

**Project:** [OT/ICS Foundations Mini-Lab](projects/ot-ics-foundations/)

### OT Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark)
Hands-on analysis of OT/ICS network traffic using Wireshark to identify device discovery, control messages, and protocol behavior in industrial control systems.
- Analyzed BACnet traffic (device discovery + NPDU/APDU inspection)
- Analyzed Modbus/TCP traffic (request/response patterns and function codes)
- Applied protocol-specific display filters and documented findings with evidence-backed screenshots
- Correlated Modbus request/response pairs to understand command execution and device behavior

**Project:** [OT Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark)](projects/ot-network-traffic-analysis/)

### OT Network Threat Detection & Incident Analysis
Simulated detection of suspicious activity in OT network traffic using an incident-analysis mindset.
- Identified risky Modbus control behavior
- Analyzed BACnet discovery traffic for reconnaissance indicators
- Documented findings and recommended mitigations for OT environments

**Project:** [OT Network Threat Detection & Incident Analysis](projects/ot-network-threat-detection/)

### Active Directory Home Lab (Windows Server 2022)
Built and organized a Windows domain lab to practice enterprise identity, access control, and structure.
- Promoted Windows Server 2022 to **Domain Controller** (AD DS + DNS)
- Created multi-region OU structure (**USA / Europe / Asia**)
- Built **Users / Computers / Servers** containers per region
- Added department OUs (**IT, HR, Accounting, Sales, Management**)
- Created users, security groups, and computer/server objects using realistic naming
